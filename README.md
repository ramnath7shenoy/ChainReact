# ChainReact ‚Äì An Agentic AI & Digital Twin Platform


A full-stack, real-time simulation platform designed to model, visualize, and analyze the **bullwhip effect** in a multi-echelon supply chain. This project serves as an interactive digital twin where users can configure agents with rule-based heuristics or a trained AI model, inject real-time disruptions, and observe the systemic impact via a live dashboard and an LLM-powered analyst.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Visualization:** A dynamic dashboard built with Next.js and Recharts that visualizes supply chain metrics streamed from the backend via **WebSockets**.
* **Agent-Based Simulation:** A sophisticated Python backend simulates four tiers of a supply chain (Retailer, Wholesaler, Distributor, Factory) as autonomous agents.
* **A/B Testing for AI Agents:** Users can configure each agent to use either a traditional, rule-based ordering strategy or a "smarter" **AI Agent** powered by a trained Scikit-learn model.
* **Interactive Disruptions:** A live control panel allows users to inject events like "Demand Spikes" into the running simulation via a RESTful API, immediately visualizing the chaotic impact.
* **LLM-Powered Analyst:** A live event log provides intelligent, dynamic commentary on simulation events (like the bullwhip effect) generated by the **Groq LLM API**.
* **Performance Dashboard:** At the conclusion of each simulation, a multi-chart dashboard appears, summarizing total costs, inventory stability, and cost breakdowns for performance analysis.
* **Database Persistence:** All simulation results, configurations, and histories are saved to a **MongoDB Atlas** cloud database for future analysis.
* **Full Containerization:** The entire full-stack application is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose** for one-command local setup.
* **Automated Cloud Deployment:** A **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** automatically builds and deploys the containerized application to **AWS App Runner**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js and npm
* Python 3.11+
* Docker Desktop
* A **MongoDB Atlas** account and connection string
* A **Groq** account and API key

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ChainReact.git](https://github.com/your-username/ChainReact.git)
    cd ChainReact
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
    * Add your secret keys and the local WebSocket URL:
        ```
        GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."
        MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://..."
        NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8001/ws/simulation
        ```

3.  **Run the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend folder: `cd backend`
    * Create and activate a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    * Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * Run the server on port 8001: `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001`

4.  **Run the Frontend:**
    * Open a **new terminal**.
    * Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd frontend`
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Run the development server on port 3001: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`

5.  **View the Application:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3001`.

## üê≥ Running with Docker

This is the simplest way to run the entire application.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
2.  **Environment:** Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root with the correct keys.
3.  **Launch:** From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
4.  **View:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3001`.
